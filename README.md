# Mariah's Bakery React App

This is the  Mariah Bakery Web Application created using React Framework.
It has several components namely the App component, which is the highest component that directly renders to the React-DOM. It consists of the Dashboard and the Sidebar components. The dashboard is the main component, which imports all other components into one main component.


### Dashboard Components

The Dashboard component is the central component. It contains:

#The form component- This is where registration of details is done for the newly registered riders emplyed by the bakery.
#The Body component- It displays the list of riders currently employed. It also allows for a logistics team member to dismiss riders who no longer work for the company.
#The search component- It shows the orders currently in the system, which have been assigned to riders for delivery. This is still under development, to allow for searching of individual orders and the riders delivering said orders, as  well as communication with the riders with regard to the progress of the orders. This will allow for the orders to be marked as delivered, and be archived in the system.
